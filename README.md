  Info: Implementing a mini-python compiler. Using sablecc.jar and our own grammar (mygramm.grammar), we're creating our own rules for helpers, tokens, productions and abstract syntax tree. The goal is to do our own lexical, syntax and semantics analysis to a portion of Python's grammar. With the help of the java files, we're able to parse a .py file and do our analysis based on our rules.
